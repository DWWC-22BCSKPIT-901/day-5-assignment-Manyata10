# DAY 5  

## Questions :  
• Given an integer k and array arr. Your task is to return the position of the first occurrence of k in the given array and if element k is not present in the array then return -1.  
• There are n available seats and n students standing in a room. You are given an array seats of length n, where seats[i] is the position of the ith seat. You are also given the array students of length n, where students[j] is the position of the jth student. You may perform the following move any number of times: Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1) Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.  
• You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties: Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order. The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.  
• You are given an m x n matrix mat that has its rows sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer k. You are allowed to choose exactly one element from each row to form an array. Return the kth smallest array sum among all possible arrays.  
• Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
